### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Profile.

I am a Ruby Engineer with roots in Colorado, currently based in Mesa, Arizona.

In 2019, I successfully completed my education at Turing School of Software and Design, marking the beginning of my professional journey in software development.

I am presently employed at Invoca, contributing to a team focused on the development and maintenance of telecommunications software.

Beyond my technical expertise, I have a profound interest in music and art, complemented by my marriage to a talented artist.

Several of my public projects on this platform originated from my learning process. Please consider this context if you happen to encounter less polished or aesthetically pleasing codeâ€”learning curves can sometimes result in unconventional solutions!
