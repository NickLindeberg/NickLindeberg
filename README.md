### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Profile.

I am a Ruby Engineer with roots in Colorado, currently based in Mesa, Arizona.

In 2019, I successfully completed my education at Turing School of Software and Design, marking the beginning of my professional journey in software development.

Beyond my technical expertise, I have a profound interest in music and art, complemented by my marriage to a talented artist.

Many of my public projects here were from my learning process, so keep that in mind if you see some ugly code, lol.
